- 👋 Hi, I’m @zqzhou7

- 👀 I’m interested in ecological patterns and processes of tidal flats. 
  - the spatio-temporal morphodynamics of tidal flats.
  - how benthic activities can affect sediment stability
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the effects of thermal stress on the bioturbation process.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
  - bioturbation effects on sediment stability.
  - thermal stress on benthos activities.
  - modeling the effects of hwatwaves on bioturbation.
